Azure PowerShell provides a set of cmdlets that use the Azure Resource Manager model for managing your Azure resources. Azure PowerShell uses .NET Standard, making it available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Azure PowerShell is also available on Azure Cloud Shell.

This documentation describes the new Az module for Azure PowerShell. This new module is written from the ground up in .NET Standard. Using .NET Standard allows Azure PowerShell to run under PowerShell 5.x on Windows or PowerShell 6 on any platform. The Az module is now the intended way to interact with Azure through PowerShell. AzureRM will continue to get bug fixes, but no longer receive new features.

Learn the full details about the new module, including how commands have been renamed and the maintenance plans for AzureRM, in the [Introducing the Azure PowerShell Az module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az). If you want to get started with using the new module right away, see [Migrate from AzureRM to Az](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/migrate-from-azurerm-to-az).
